## My process
  It was hard for me at first to figure out how to display the hidden picture with the centered eye 
  but i'm glad i was able to do it 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

i learnt how to do a magic trick with the div element and it was fun 

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  z-index: 999;
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;
  transform: translate(-8%);
}
```
